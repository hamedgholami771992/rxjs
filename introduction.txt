Observables: 
    - The observables are like data/event generators with some logic stored inside
    - the data they generate can have various sources like ann array values, DOM events, Http requests, timers, 
        actually anything you want, can be converted into an observable
    - now we need to execute it somehow, so it starts generating the data
    - to run the code placed inside of an observable, we need to subscribe to it

what we can do with the data emitted by the observables
    - in most cases you will want to consume the data emitted by an observable and run a logic that you would like to run for each emitted value
    and if something goes wrong you can provide some error handling logic 
    

In simple words, Observables are like functions, which generate some values once we subscribe to them

An observable is like a function which we can execute and which then runs its logic and can return multiple values at various points of time

recommendation: add $ at the end of the name of observable like --> name$
